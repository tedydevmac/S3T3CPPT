No stage: stringTokenizationFunc.py
Used in datasetOnePreprocessing.py, datasetTwoPreprocessing.py, logisticRegression.py

Stage 1 - Gather Data
In report, not in code

Stage 2 - Data Pre-Processing
Dataset 1: datasetOnePreprocessing.py
Dataset 2: datasetTwoPreprocessing.py
After concatenating datasets: jointDatasetPreprocessing.py
Run datasetOnePreprocessing.py and datasetTwoPreprocessing.py before jointDatasetPreprocessing.py

Stage 3 - Choose and Train Model, Stage 4 - Evaluate and Tune Model and Stage 5 - Make Predictions
Logistic Regression: logisticRegression.py 
K-Nearest-Neighbours: knn.py
Stage 3, 4 and 5 are all in the same file (indicated by comments)
